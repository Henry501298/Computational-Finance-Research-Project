# Stock-Market-Quantitative-Research-Project
Portfolios are created for perspective research only and to track portfolio performances of different combination of stocks. Stocks mentioned in these portfolios should not be taken as a recommendation to buy or sell securities mentioned. I am not a license finance professional, just a retail value investor with a passion for learning data science techniques to improve my personal investment portfolio. I aspire to become an Equity / Quantitative Research Analyst and then one day lead to a career in portfolio management. I developed my skills from watching youtube, and taking courses from Udemy education on python for finance applications. I'am stil a beginner at learning python and applying it to a finance setting. Everyday I am constantly improving my skills and learning new strategies.
